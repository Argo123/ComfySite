A simple Angular 18.0.2 project made for my portfolio.
No real life usage but may be a way to learn (and demonstrate) some Angular features:
- RxJS basic usage
- simple API communication
- default unit tests implementation using Jasmine
- Angular animations (those are wild by default)
- project structure and modules
- ways of passing variables between components and style templates
- that you can use .svg instead of .html in Angular components :)
